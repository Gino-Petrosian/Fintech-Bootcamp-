# LABS business model and Digitizing Real Estate


## Overview and Origin
* What is the name of the company?    

The name of the company I chose for this challenge is LABS (Liquid Asset Borkerage System). LABS is a real estate investment digital ecosystem.

* When was the company incorporated?

The company was incorporated in 2018.(1)

* Who are the founders of the company?

LABS was founded by Yuen Wong. Yueng Wong has his MBA in Corporate Entreprenuership, is involved in several startups including e-commerce and professional services. He also specializes in business strategy and development, go-to-market strategic planning, and is well connected and resourceful. (2)  Alongside LABS, he also Advises many sucessful Blockchain projects. The projects he currently is collarboating and advising for is Dreams.Quest, Exverse.io, Bitmart, & GEMS Gameing and Esports platform 3.0. He is very well versed in the cryptocurrency domain and appears to be the right partner in the journey to tokenize real estate (Not to mention his experience as a managing partner of a real estate advisory firm named Ayana Properties)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
    
The idea generated from the high cost to entry barrier in Real Estate Investing. They are fostering a method that can result in greater market participation amongst Individual & Institutional investors. Because of they're method for Investing, they are disrupting real estate through the worldâ€™s first end to end real estate investment ecosystem by fractionalizing real estate investments.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Initially, the project was funded by Yuen Wong and his parter for the first 2 years (14). Yuen Wong discloses he recieved funding after this point (according to crunchbase, they have a total of 5 investors in the project (12)) but shifted its primary funding to the IDO in 2021. The IDO raised 12.1M USD when it was released. As of 09/17/2023 they're current market capitalization is $829,437 (13). 

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
 
Traditionally, Real estate investments to develop commercial assets have been dominated by institutional investors. Individual investors are typically limited to residential properties (3). LABS intends to extend market participation by resolving these key pain points in Real Estate Investing; High Entry and Exit costs, REITS (sellable only to local markets), Difficult Access to a Global Portfolio, Liquidity Issues, Complex process of buying overseas, and high fees associated with it all(4). Currently, there are factors to the process of selling, renting, or owning a property that add value to the already high fees of entering and exiting a property sale. For the buyer, these fees can equate to a 2-5% increase of the purchasing price with all processes considered (11). Placing and tokenizing these assets onto a smart contract can eliminate some of the fees associated with basic R.E. transactions. Global Real Estate is no different and can even experience more fees and delayes in processing. With the use of the blockchain LABS uses, instant settlement & automation of document processing can make for a more efficient & less cost transaction. LABS differs from REITs in Four significant ways; (5)

1. REITs are listed on the Stock Exchange, which is limited to business hours trading window. Once the assets tokens are listed on a security token exchange, it becomes tradable 24 hours a day 7 days a week.

2. REITs are designed around single investment types (e.g., commercial, residential). With LABS digitized asset tokens, opprtunity opens for a more diversified real estate portfolio.

3. REITs typically come with many expenses that are passed along to individual investors. With digitized asset tokens, LABs anticpates lower expenses, resulting in more profit for the token holders.

4. REITs have many limitations and restrictions, such as who can and cannot invest. The decisions are left in the hands of investment managers which dictate what happens to the investors investment. Effectively taking control away from the investor. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The companies intended customer are Individual and Insititutional Real Estate Investors.  Market size would be right around 320.78 Trillion (Laregt asset class in the world). This information is consistent with HSBC's report in 2016 Global Real Estate Investment was valued at 228 million and was expected to increase 5% year after year (6).


* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) 

The solution the company offers is there competitve advantage in itself. Fractionalized Real Estate. Because money is needed up front for investing in real estate for a down payment, Taxes, Fee's, & Insurance. They can make this more attainable by fractionalizing it all, Along the way also offering rewards that can result in luxurious stays at hotels around the world and VIP Ticket games to Emirates games! 
Fractionalizing Real Estate allows the investor to take sole control of their portfolio and what goes in. No longer will people need to limit there portfolio to local investments or one that is friendly to the investors finances. They can invest anywhere they'd like on LABS and diversify theyre portfolio by reducing risk to their appetites and prefrences. The licensed and regulated exchange they are working on launching will bring a whole new investing landscape to real estate.
    
They are currently implementing blockchain through Tokenization and NFT's. Tokenization is a major part of the LABS investment ecosystem as it enables trading of tangible assets and accessing liquidity using tokens backed by the asset. Providing more stability in LABS coins over other crypto projects LABS can attiubute this success through tokenization itself. Tokenzation is the transformative process of converting tangible assets, such as real estate, securities, or digital assets, into tokens on a blockchain. Traditionally known for Real Estates illiquidity, fractional ownership provides unprecedented liquidity in an industry that is mostly illiquid. Tokenizing Real Estate assets entailes creating a smart contract on a block chain platform and in this case; the chain chosen orginally was ethereum but due to high gas fees they migrated to the use of BNB Chain a layer 1 blockchain system.(7) They chose BNB Chain because there were less fee's involved with trading on BNB's chain and is development friendly.(8) Among other technology involved in tokenization is cross-boarder trasactions. Because this ecosystem resides on the blockhain, Cross-Boarder transactions makes investing more accessible to investors in different parts of the world.
    
Other technologies being used in the LABS ecosystem currently are NFT's. When users of the LABS ecosystem acquire these NFT's, they will gain access to a tiered reward system based on minting of the NFT's. The rewards offered vary from stays in LABS first Real Estate investment tent (15 different stays of 4 Days and 3 Nights each stay) all the way to 10 Private jet flights (from HCMC to PhuQuoc) 4 Days and 3 Nights stay at a partner hotel aswell.(9) Rewards are issued only under the minting terms. Untill that point, LABS accumulates the generated funds into a Owners fund where they focus on increasing yield for long term  holders.

Funds accrued in the wallet address will be invested into separate verticals of Real Estate akin to a balanced portfolio, focusing on distressed assets at prime locations. The strategy would be to invest in properties to maximize yield for long term holders, and to build up more capital by flipping land in up and coming locations. Ultimately, the fund will be used to accumulate more high yield property to constantly give rewards to our holders. The strategy for investing in different properties would be to invest 50% of wallet into High Yield Properties (Residential and Industrial); 40% into commercial properties (Resorts and Hotel); with 10% into flipping land(maximum risk LABS is willing to take against these properties are hold times of 6 months)(10)
  

## LandscapeAnything Fi

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
The domain LABS is under is Crytpo-currency and Real Estate. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this industry in the past 5-10 years?
The most significant innovation sweeping the real estate industry is Tokenization. Tokenization allows the user to digitize their tangible asset and fractionalize it into digital coins. The asset backed coin sheds the partial value of the asset where the total circulating supply for that asset is equal to the par value of the property. This minimized the entry barrier for real estate investing as it allows users to invest in property without committing large amounts of risk in their portfolio. Their true risk tolerance became more definable with tokenization.


* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Other major companies mixing Real Estate with crypto currency is Propy, RealT, & Mattereum (15). Each of these companies are independent of eachother. Propy offers a more defined and specified service related to the sale and purchasing of property. They're main function in the marketplace is automation in the backend processes related to the sale and transfer of the property. They aim to remove the stacks of papers involved in the sale and transfer of property where mortgage underwriting and escrow can take weeks to process all along with access to liquidity at a faster rate(16). Another more direct competitor hosting similar business models to that of LABS is RealT. Theyre main differenciating factor amongst eachother but more importantly to LABs group is theyre target audience. RealT aims to serve the international investor by providing a streamline of digitized real estate investment opportunities into the U.S..(17) Limited to international investors, they are launching a new service for U.S. customers.

    


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
LABS Group appears to strive for market participation, global resort style real estate investing and merging traditionial investing methods. To date, LABS has innovated use cases for NFT's by partnering with so far the Emirates soccer team as well as a Resort in Dubai. With certain NFT's you can earn rewards described earlier in this analysis of LABS Group. Financially, LABS does not appear to be struggling. While their market share price is currently near its lowest price(18), they have done giveaways for their supporters in the project where they would give 2,000USD. Investors are neutral with business oulook. TThere has been investments made in Physical real estate showing as a company asset.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Because this is a cryptocurrency project we need to consider basic tokenomics in part of out metrics measurig success. 
Metrics involved in measuring succes would inlcude Token Liqudity, Asset Appreciation, Token Adoption, Compliance and Regulation, Market Capitalization Token price, and Community Engagement. LABS Group is doing a pheonomenal in these metrics, They're biggest slack across these metrics is its Token price. They joined the market with a Token price as high as 06 cents. Currently, their token price is near its lowest price. 
This is due to the fact that their main attraction to their project has not bewen reached yet. They anticipate their Real Estate Investing Exchange. While they have launched other serivces. Theyre real estate exchange would have the biggest impact on their Token price outlook.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Competitors relative to labs are currently positioned better in the marketplace. When considering the current position of LABS Group relative to their compteitors in todays marketplace, they are significantly lower. Significant differences are observed due to the comparison of the seperate goals. While LABS aim is to drive investing in real estate resort style commercial styled properties, theyre goal is to release the first Real Estate digitized trading exchange similar to the stock market as described earlier in this Analysis. With competitors in the pursuit of enhanced efficiency and opportunities, LABS aims to foster innovation and reimagine the conventional running wheel by integrating todays technological advancements. Understandably LABS is in a smaller position relative to market size and analytics but they have something bigger being worked on that can drive them a industrial leader in Real Estate Digitization.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
If there was one thing I could offer that they may already be doing just being left under the radar. I would suggest implement residential investing as this would unveil a large portion of the market that would amplify their marekt reach. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
I believe it is a great route they are taking as they are assuring liquidity by opening investing opportunity in low risk real estate assets but it is a huge industry valued at $1.5 Trillion(19), the residential real estate industry is the larget class of Relal Estate properties. Its no wonder why as the largest class they are valued at 47 Trillion in June of 2023(20) 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
I dont think it would be a matter of tewchnology as they would use the same digitization methods used to digitze other types of real estate property. I believe it would more so be a matter of establishing the necessary connections to be able to acomplish such a greast stride. I believe emulating and taking actions as a regulatory body initself would also lead to great success as all these hard assets being linked together in a marekting trading envionrnment when built on bad frame works can open and leave room for detrimental effects on local and possibly national economies. Maybe a type of regulation rather than technology I think would be needed is a decentralzied region style frame work for local economies particpating in the trading activity be managed by a group of board members overwatching local economical analytics and assuring liquidity is always there.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
I think my regulatory recommendation would be necessary to avoid another crash in the housing markets due to examples such as lack of liquidity or lack of solid frameworks leading to inefficiencies.
