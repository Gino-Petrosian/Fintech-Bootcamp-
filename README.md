    The companies intended customer are Individual and Insititutional Real Estate Investors. Traditionally, Real estate investments to develop commercial assets have been
    dominated by institutional investors. Individual investors are typically limited to residential properties (3). LABS intends to extend the market participation by acknowledging these key pain points in Real Estate Investing; High Entry and Exit costs, REITS (sellable only to local markets), Difficult Access to a Global Portfolio, Liquidity Issues, Complex process of buying overseas, and high fees associated with it all(4). Market size would be right around 320.78 Trillion.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) 

    The solution the company offers is there competitve advantage in itself. Fractionalized Real Estate. Because money is needed up front for investing in real estate for a down payment, Taxes, Fee's, & Insurance. They can make this more attainable by fractionalizing it all, Along the way also offering rewards that can result in luxurious stays at hotels around the world and VIP Ticket games to Emirates games! 
    Fractionalizing Real Estate allows the investor to take sole control of their portfolio and what goes in. No longer will people need to limit there portfolio to local investments or one that is friendly to the investors finances. They can invest anywhere they'd like on LABS and diversify theyre portfolio by reducing risk to their appetites and prefrences. The licensed and regulated exchange they are working on launching will bring a whole new investing landscape to real estate.
    
    They are currently implementing blockchain through Tokenization and NFT's. Tokenization is a major part of the LABS investment ecosystem as it enables trading of tangible assets and accessing liquidity using tokens backed by the asset. Providing more stability in LABS coins over other crypto projects LABS can attiubute this success through tokenization itself. Tokenzation is the transformative process of converting tangible assets, such as real estate, securities, or digital assets, into tokens on a blockchain. Traditionally known for Real Estates illiquidity, fractional ownership provides unprecedented liquidity in an industry that is mostly illiquid. Tokenizing Real Estate assets entailes creating a smart contract on a block chain platform and in this case; the chain chosen orginally was ethereum but due to high gas fees they migrated to the use of BNB Chain a layer 1 blockchain system.(6) They chose BNB Chain because there were less fee's involved with trading on BNB's chain and is development friendly.(7) Among other technology involved in tokenization is cross-boarder trasactions. Because this ecosystem resides on the blockhain, Cross-Boarder transactions makes investing more accessible to investors in different parts of the world.
    
    Other technologies being used in the LABS ecosystem currently are NFT's. When users of the LABS ecosystem acquire these NFT's, they will gain access to a tiered reward system based on minting of the NFT's. The rewards offered vary from stays in LABS first Real Estate investment tent (15 different stays of 4 Days and 3 Nights each stay) all the way to 10 Private jet flights (from HCMC to PhuQuoc) 4 Days and 3 Nights stay at a partner hotel aswell.(8) Rewards are issued only under the minting terms. Untill that point, LABS accumulates the generated funds into a Owners fund where they focus on increasing yield for long term  holders.

    Funds accrued in the wallet address will be invested into separate verticals of Real Estate akin to a balanced portfolio, focusing on distressed assets at prime locations. The strategy would be to invest in properties to maximize yield for long term holders, and to build up more capital by flipping land in up and coming locations. Ultimately, the fund will be used to accumulate more high yield property to constantly give rewards to our holders. The strategy for investing in different properties would be to invest 50% of wallet into High Yield Properties (Residential and Industrial); 40% into commercial properties (Resorts and Hotel); with 10% into flipping land(maximum risk LABS is willing to take against these properties are hold times of 6 months)(9)
